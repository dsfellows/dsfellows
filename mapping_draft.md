JSON = javascript object notation

a standard for storing and transmitting data. meant to be human and machine-readable

vs csv: this lets you nest your data. doesn't seem like the historical preservation data set is really using methods?

[JSON editor online](http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/) will add white space and indentation to make a json file more readable

"GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures. GeoJSON supports the following geometry types: Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, and MultiPolygon. Geometric objects with additional properties are Feature objects. Sets of features are contained by FeatureCollection objects." ([source](http://geojson.org/))

had to clean the historical markers data set a little to get it to work as a dataset: latitude was misspelled as "lattitude," coordinates for two rows were blank. have everyone troubleshoot this

in the historical resources dataset, labels for latitude and longitude coordinates are reversed ;-;

[Historical preservation sites](http://www.preservationalliance.com/explore-philadelphia/) in Philly

[Mapbox workflow](https://www.mapbox.com/help/define-dataset/)

have everyone come up with a question/thing they want to visualize using some combination of the datasets, design a map together or in groups

experiment with editing/paring down the dataset within mapbox- or is it easier to do in an outside program like openrefine/excel? try both?

try to create maps we can use in the project

show how to embed a map on a reclaim site
put an example of the code on github
