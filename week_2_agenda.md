# Github

+ Make sure everyoneâ€™s been added to our repo, accepted invitation
+ Basic explanation of what Github does; we'll go into more depth in session 3 or 4
+ Show repo commit history (use syllabus?)

# Internet play

+ _Plan for this?_

# Download a text editor

+ Use [Atom](https://atom.io/)
+ You can drag a folder onto the icon to open it

# The most basic possible website

+ Download zip file from Github: html_css_examples.zip
+ Example of simple, one-file HTML/CSS static site; open in browser
+ Basic HTML syntax: can you add items to a lists? Link to a different page? Include a different image?
+ Command-slash will comment highlighted text out in Atom; practice that
+ Add link to a local stylesheet
+ Can you change the background color on the stylesheet?
+ Add and define a class
+ Try linking to Bootstrap in the stylesheet
+ Add an element from Bootstrap

# A more complicated static site

+ Look at an html5up site template with multiple pages _(Forty?)_
+ Project this; people can download if they want
+ Basic overview of what files are included: index.html, main.css, image folder, etc.
+ Find the place in index.html that creates the menu. What if you want to change what appears on the menu? Try it: only the front page will change, not the others, unless you change those by hand
+ This is the type of problem we'll eventually be able to solve with Jekyll

# Static vs. dynamic website

+ Laurie shows one of the Penn DS Omeka sites
+ Pieces of each page are stored separately and are created (and compiled) at the time when you ask for them

# Reclaim

+ Everyone registers a domain name
+ Look at file manager: you can drop in any of the files we were just working with and have a basic website
+ Everyone downloads an html5up template and experiments with customizing one thing
