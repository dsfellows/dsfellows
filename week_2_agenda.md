# Github

+ Make sure everyoneâ€™s been added to our repo, accepted invitation
+ Basic explanation of what Github does; we'll go into more depth in session 3 or 4
+ But demonstrate committing changes while changing HTML/CSS file - using command line? App? Both?

# Internet play

# Download a text editor

+ Have everyone use Atom?

# The most basic possible website

+ Download zip file from Github: [link]
+ Example of simple, one-file HTML/CSS static site; open in browser
+ Can you change the color? Add items to the lists? Link to a different page? Include a different image?
+ Command-slash will comment highlighted text out in Atom
+ What happens when you add in a link to a stylesheet?
+ Make some basic change to stylesheet (make a list then define a list class?)

# A more complicated static site

+ Look at an html5up site template with multiple pages (Forty?)
+ Basic overview of what files are included: index.html, style sheet, etc.
+ _Basic HTML and CSS syntax?_
+ What if you want to add (say) the same menu to each page? IT'S HARD

# Static vs. dynamic website

+ Laurie shows one of the Penn DS Omeka sites
+ Instead of storing HTML for each page, the page is being generated when you call on the server
+ It's complicated

# Reclaim

+ Everyone registers a domain name
+ Look at file manager: you can drop in any of the files we were just working with and have a basic website
+ Everyone downloads an html5up template and experiments with customizing one thing
