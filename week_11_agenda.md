# Brainstorm: what could you do with your domain?

# Reclaim basics

To edit your site, go to [https://reclaimhosting.com/](https://reclaimhosting.com/). Click Client Area Login and enter your login details.

Click on cPanel (in the menu bar along the top). This is your control panel, which will let you manage applications and edit/add files to the site.

Click File Manager in the menu bar.

The public_html folder contains the files that generate the "front end" or visible part of your site. This is the folder you'll be working with when you edit your site.

public_html/img stores the images for your site. Try adding an image. Can you figure out where that image appears on your site/what URL you need to use to find it?

What's in the CSS and JS folders? Can you figure out how to view these files on your website?

You can also use various applications to build/design your site for you instead of coding it yourself (for example, Wordpress or Omeka). Go back to your cPanel and click All Applications. Scroll through the options. Try installing one. What happens (in the file manager, and to the 'front end' of your site)?

# The future

Your Reclaim account will expire in a year. If you want to keep your site, you'll have the option to either renew it for $30/year or transfer your site to a free hosting service.

[To move a Wordpress site hosted on Reclaim to a free Wordpress URL, see these instructions.](https://en.support.wordpress.com/moving-from-self-hosted-wordpress-to-wordpress-com/)

[To create a backup of your Reclaim site (which will give you a copy of your files that you can use to transfer your site to a different domain), see these instructions.](https://community.reclaimhosting.com/t/generating-a-backup/293)

You might consider moving your site to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which will host it for free at yourusername.github.io. Example: this [Early Novels Database website](https://earlynovels.github.io/), created using Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages.

# Exercise

Choose a theme for your site from Wordpress or [html5up](https://html5up.net/). Try customizing menus, text, images, etc.

OR:

Create a simple landing page for your site using HTML and CSS.

OR:

Continue work on a Jekyll site that you'll be able to host on your Github (or potentially your Reclaim site!)
