find some examples of personal sites. of academics? other people? stuff built with wordpress and other platforms? project websites…? brief discussion of what people might want to do with their personal domains so we can tailor the rest to that

do a more systematic intro to how to use the Reclaim sites - ‘here’s the file manager, here’s how to install an application and use that to build your site,’ etc. can use mine and/or the penn DS reclaim account as examples

how to create subdomains - so you can have one bit running wordpress then also add html pages, etc

something on how to renew / back up the site once the domain Penn bought everyone runs out

split up based on whether people want to work on their reclaim sites (either with the file manager or wordpress) or do more jekyll (helping people who didn't get there finish the install, then maybe doing a guided tour of whatever theme they've installed/possibly the END site once that's done?)
