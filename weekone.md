# Week one


1. Greetings!  Who is here?
Icebreaker? Learning names game
Name, class year, major, one reason you applied/one thing you hope to get out of the fellowship, fun fact (food?)

2. What is digital scholarship? How are people thinking about this? Questions about what’s included? What work have they done that could be considered digital scholarship, regardless of whether they were calling it that yet?
Show some examples of DS projects
Look at ML, now or later?

3. Syllabus (rough is ok, but enough for them to get excited and curious)
Yumi can present current draft of syllabus ideas
Any other syllabus topic ideas? Questions about DS that we could try to address? Things we’ve already suggested that they definitely want to cover?

4. Project conversation — what do we want to do together? planting some seeds for potential long term outcomes.
* Laurie can show them some ML stuff
* We’re going to be using ML to explore the syllabus topics through the year. Brainstorm: what kind of involvement do we want to have? What kinds of projects would people be interested in?


5. Logistics
Next meeting date---- FALL BREAK IS OCT 6
(Thanksgiving is also on a Thursday)
Seven sessions in the fall, seven in the spring, 10 weeks in the summer
How much would people like to keep in touch outside of the biweekly meetings? Use Slack or similar platform? Other ideas?

Syllabus draft

Anatomy of information
Beautiful websites in the clouds
Follow-up session on web design, start working with Reclaim sites
Disability and access (save this for later when we’ve been working on the websites longer? Or try to integrate it into the project work from the start?)
Data management (looking at raw data from monument lab, how could we organize it? what other data might be collected? maybe try cleaning data with openrefine/excel/etc)
Continued work with metadata - Omeka exhibits from monument lab data?
Text analysis (working with texts about Philadelphia/various monument lab sites - topic modeling? Voyant? NER? some combination? Voyant and NER one week, then topic modeling the next?)
Mapping
Work with design - photoshop?
3D printing
Combine collaboration, labor, and infrastructure with scholarly project management?
Copyright (history and legality; designing monument lab procedures)

Split some of these into two sessions? Add things?
