### Intro to Jekyll

+ Install Jekyll, following [these instructions](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

# Review of servers, directories, and urls
+ Copy site directory to Reclaim hosting account (this is not the recommended method for hosting jekyll sites! You'll learn that later)

# Git continued
+ What are commits? Branches? Forks? Why do we like them?

# Monuments, memory, and minimal computing

# Resources
