## Early modern information technologies

### One genealogy of information management practices

+ 4th century debates over whether the codex or the scroll was the superior form for religious texts
+ 13th century: rise of navigational aids for Christian bibles (e.g. concordances, alphabetical indexes, library catalogues)
  + On the alphabetized index: "At first, the alphabetic system that we take for granted was actively resisted, because it led to arbitrary relations between words and even to logical inversions, in which the created preceded the creator (Filia coming before Pater, Angelus before Deus) and inversions of social hierarchy (Filia coming before Filius, Mater before Pater)." (Stallybrass, *Books and Scrolls*, 44)
+ 15th century invention of printing press -> these developments began to be more systematically used in printed books (including consistent pagination, tables of contents, running titles)

### Geneva Bible, bound with Robert Herrey's concordance (1581)

+ Looking at the title page, how is this Bible being advertised?
+ What are some ways you could read through it?
+ Evidence of readers' interactions with it (marginalia on p. 179; other traces?)
+ What do the two concordances do?
  + (Stallybrass: first alphabet proliferates meanings, second controls against that proliferation; "anti-Catholic slant". see entry for Abominable)
+ How could you navigate through a digital version of this text? How would that compare to the types of reading this print version allows for or encourages?

> "Contemporary pronouncements about the death of the book are puzzling, for in many ways, it is the book form--the *combination* of the ability to scroll with the capacity for random access, enabling you to leap from place to place--that has provided the model which these other cultural technologies now seek to emulate. Computers, for instance, with their extraordinary powers of random access, are for most people extremely ungainly and unwieldy in their scroll functions. But computers take to a new level a crucial aspect of the ways in which we often use books--our ability, through bookmarks, to have our fingers in many different places at the same time, and to move rapidly from one to another." (Stallybrass, *Books and Scrolls*, 42)

+ Skeumorphism: "[M]y Macintosh computer still uses a little hand to travel around the screen and a pointing finger. And when I find a new website, I add a 'bookmark,' visualized nostalgically at the top of my screen as a blue ribbon. The navigation of computers is still imagined in the visual language that was elaborated in the fifteenth century for the navigation of books: the language of the index finger and of its prosthetic form, the bookmark." (46)
+ Arguably, first DH project was [Father Roberto Busa's](http://stephenramsay.us/2011/08/11/father-roberto-busa/) creation of a computer-generated [concordance](http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/it/index.age) to the works of Thomas Aquinas

### Printers' ornaments

+ Parallel with Bootstrap elements?

## Anatomizing the language, indexing the novel

+ *A Dictionary of the English Language* (1755): one of the first comprehensive English-language dictionaries, prepared by Samuel Johnson and a group of assistants between 1746 and 1755
+ *Sir Charles Grandison* (1754), third (?) edition: epistolary novel by Samuel Richardson
+ Richardson was one of the only contemporary novelists extensively quoted in Johnson's dictionary
+ Looking at *Sir Charles Grandison*, what are some ways you might read through? Where do the footnotes direct you?
+ What do the tables/indices at the back do?
+ Where do we think Johnson found his quotes?
+ What are some ways one might read through *Clarissa*? Where do the footnotes direct you?
+ Definitions for "plication" and "quaggy" in Johnson: difficulties of life without keyword search
+ "A study of *Clarissa* [another of Richardson's novels] alongside the Dictionary shows that nearly all of Johnson’s quotations from *Clarissa* were lifted directly from the table, the *index rerum*, with only a couple of notable exceptions." (Valenza, *How Literature Becomes Knowledge*, 219)
+ Analogy to database/keyword search?

> A clearer sense of the role indices played for Johnson might be gained by noting that Pope’s mock praise of “index-learning” might be doubly applied to its modern equivalent—database (or search-engine) learning. The apparent comprehensiveness of a modern database, in which potentially no word is left uncataloged, thoroughly relieves the reader of the obligation to read the whole of anything. And although Swift worries that “large Indexes, and little Compendiums” might come to replace real study, and the *Dunciad*’s satire gestures towards the prevalence of such study (careless, slippery, and dangerous though it may be), these satires also, perhaps despite themselves, gesture towards the usefulness of index-learning. (Valenza 222)

## Note-taking and the commonplace book

> "Aristotle suggests that readers should “select . . . from the written handbooks of argument, and should draw up sketch-lists of them upon each several kind of subject, putting them down under separate headings, e.g. ‘On Good,’ or ‘On Life’-and that ‘On Good’ should deal with every form of good, beginning with the category of essence.” In its medieval incarnation, students (and scholars) would copy and subsequently memorize quotations gleaned from their read- ing, arranging them under various general topics. Locke recommended the same (with some suggested headings) in his seventeenth-century educational writings. The quotations thus identified could then serve as evidence for an argument." (Valenza 220)

+ How does this relate to the other materials we've looked at?
+ What use might it have served for its creator?
+ How does this compare to your (digital or non-digital) notetaking practices? To forms of online information organization like the ones we've talked about?

## Wrap-up

+ What’s the physical experience of looking something up in one of these books like?
+ What information do you have access to? How quickly can you retrieve it?
+ In what space might you encounter a book like this? A library? A home? How much did it cost, and who would have access?
+ How could you navigate through these texts if you had digitized versions of them?
Is there anything you can do with the print version that you couldn't with a digital one?
