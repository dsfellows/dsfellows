# Intro - testimonials from fellows

"I've learned how to build websites, how they work, and how to think about data. I think this program is extremely necessary on campus and can be a great way to springboard technological interest and access for students who wouldn't otherwise receive it." - Amani

"This Fellowship was an incredibly opportunity that, if anything, has made me even more excited to learn about new tools and software as well as embark on new digital projects!" - Andres

# [Week 1 (9/22): Introduction to Digital Scholarship](https://github.com/dsfellows/dsfellows/blob/master/week_1_agenda.md)

The Fellows met for the first time to discuss what digital scholarship is and what role it might play in their work across disciplines--from architecture to English to anthropology to computer science. What does a term like "digital scholarship" mean when tools such as word processors, digital editions of texts, and search algorithms have become so ubiquitous in academic work? How can we, and should we distinguish between digital tools or methods and digital objects of study when defining digital scholarship?


# [Week 2 (10/13): Beautiful Websites in the Clouds](https://github.com/dsfellows/dsfellows/blob/master/week_2_agenda.md)

In this session, the Fellows explored how the online world they interact with every day is created. How does a web browser find and display a website? What is a server? A DNS? When we store things in "the cloud," how are they preserved, and where are they kept physically?

[excerpt from Laurie's play]

From there, we moved on to an exploration of how web pages are created in more practical terms. How do HTML, CSS, and Javascript combine to form beautiful web pages? What distinguishes static from dynamic websites?

# [Week 3 (10/27): Anatomy of Information](https://github.com/dsfellows/dsfellows/blob/master/week_3_agenda.md)

[use one of Alice's special collections photos]

With the aid of John Pollack, the Library Specialist for Public Services at Penn's Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts, we took the fellows on a whirlwild tour of some of Penn's most exciting rare materials. After a brief tutorial on how to safely handle rare books, the Fellows paged through texts including a 16th-century Bible and concordance and an 18th-century edition of Samuel Johnson's dictionary, one of the first ever published in the English language.

They also explored William Penn's [title tk], which included his initial plan for the city of Philadelphia, organized around five public squares--one of the inspirations for this year's Monument Lab sites.

During this session, the Fellows talked through some of the (dis)continuities between print and digital media. What goes into digitizing these types of rare materials? How do concordances, indexes, and the like compare to digital technologies of search and organization that we use today? How can the printed past help us to think about our digital present?



# Week 4 (11/10): Monument Lab conversation with Paul Farber

[Paul Farber](http://www.paulfarber.com/), Monument Lab Artistic Director and Urban Studies professor, joined us to discuss the project's take on collective memory and history, and how digital projects can drive social change.

# [Week 5 (11/10): Web Design, Continued](https://github.com/dsfellows/dsfellows/blob/master/week_5_agenda.md)

The Fellows explored some basics of Git, a version control system optimized for tracking changes to code in collaborative digital projects. From there, we dived into Jekyll, a static site generator that can build minimal, fast-loading websites from simple HTML and CSS files.

Andres De los Rios went on to use Jekyll to build a professional website, hosting the files Github Pages as we'd practiced during the session.

# [Week 6 (12/8): Data Management](https://github.com/dsfellows/dsfellows/blob/master/week_6_agenda.md)

This session introduced the Fellows to metadata, the "data about data" that powers so much of the digital (and library) worlds. Each Fellow took ten minutes to sketch out their own Monument Lab proposal using the official Monument Lab form. Topics ranged from [examples tk- look back at the forms]

[images of a few of the fellows' proposals]

Then, collaborating via Google Sheets, they created a metadata schema for recording information about those proposals and some others from Monument Lab. Even the creation of such a small data set turned out to require a complex series of decisions: to what extent should seemingly straightforward categories like address and age be standardized, given the wide variety of ways in which participants responded to those questions? Should metadata refer primarily to the proposal form itself, or to the monument bring proposed?

From there, we switched gears to consider how best to work with messy data sets--like the one we'd just created. The Fellows experimented with ways of analyzing and cleaning existing Monument Lab data using OpenRefine, an open-source tool designed to make work with large, complex data sets easier.

"The session on OpenRefine was particularly impactful. Before [the DS Fellows program], if I downloaded relevant data that was arranged messily, I would not have known how to sort through it. However, the session on OpenRefine taught me how to make sense of such data using this new tool." - Abby




# [Week 7 (1/23): Mapping](https://github.com/dsfellows/dsfellows/blob/master/week_7_agenda.md)

During this session, the Fellows explored various ways of recording and visualizing geographical data. Using Mapbox, an open-source tool for creating beautiful, granular visualizations, the Fellows investigated three separate, overlapping data sets: one of Monument Lab proposals, one of historic preservation sites in Philadelphia, and one of historical markers.

[screenshots of example maps, maybe also visualizations of individual data sets? visual representation of structure of a geojson data set?]

Nick Joyner used what he learned in this session to create a final project for a course on critical cartography: a visualization that compares Monument Lab proposals dealing with topics such as human rights, inequality, and gentrification with existing Philadelphia monuments on those same subjects.

"The program has completely redefined what I thought I understood as digital scholarship. I did not realize the great digitizations of written data, much less the various tools to use that information in different ways. As an urban studies major, I have taken away invaluable information. I will absolutely use my knowledge in Mapbox from DS in my future classes and research." - Abby

# [Week 9 (2/20): Intro to Computational Text Analysis](https://github.com/dsfellows/dsfellows/blob/master/week_9_agenda.md)

This session introduced the Fellows to some basics of computational text analysis and text mining using a corpus of 27 publicly available texts about the city of Philadelphia, published between 1681 and 1921. We asked a number of questions about what it means to use these methods: Can we learn things from these computational methods that we couldn't learn from reading these texts straight through? And what can we learn about how Philadelphia has been imagined in writing from using these tools on this specific corpus?

First, the Fellows tested out Voyant, which produces simple visualizations such as word clouds and word frequency counts:

[images of different Voyant visualizations]

Next, the Fellows experimented with topic modeling, which uses Bayesian statistical models to identify clusters of words that are likely to appear together within certain texts. Over recent years, topic models have become an increasingly popular tool for digital humanities work.

[image of a topic model; maybe also image of the number spreadsheet Scott's topic modeling tool generates- back end]

[additional sentence about what this tells us about Philly, what trends we saw]

"I really enjoyed the session on topic modeling and data visualizations, especially since they are both tools that, in my opinion, could help bridge the current gap between specialized scholarship and general audiences (be it in books, journals, museums, or the like)." - Andres




# [Week 10 (3/13): Ying teaches Illustrator!](https://github.com/dsfellows/dsfellows/blob/master/week_10_agenda.md)

[does Kirara have images from this?]




# Week 11 (3/27): Video editing workshop, guest taught by Robert Curry!

Robert Curry, a filmmaker and instructor at Philly's University of the Arts, gave the Fellows a crash course in video editing, from importing footage to cutting it together to saving and exporting the final product. Working with footage from a UArts acting and directing class, the Fellows practiced cutting between and within scenes and adding text titles and transitions. They also discussed what a hypothetical Monument Lab documentary might look like: what about the project would be most compelling to capture on film? How might a film cut between interviews with participants, images of their proposals, and shots of the sites in Philadelphia they engaged with?

[not sure since we didn't save any of the videos we worked on (from a student acting class). I might try to do gif versions of some of the old-school video transitions people used...]


# [Week 12 (4/10): Reclaim crash course](https://github.com/dsfellows/dsfellows/blob/master/week_11_agenda.md)

At the start of the program, each of the Fellows was given a Reclaim Hosting domain that they could use to experiment with web design and, ultimately, to craft a personal website. This session was designed to give the Fellows the tools to start putting work they'd generated during the Fellowship, as well as future projects, up on their websites.

After talking through a number of options for designing their sites, from hand-coding pages to using Reclaim's Wordpress plugin, the Fellows chose to experiment further with using [html5up](https://html5up.net/) templates to create landing pages for their sites.

[see if someone will let us use their site as an example]



# [Week 12 (4/24): Data refuge, wrap-up](https://github.com/dsfellows/dsfellows/blob/master/week_12_agenda.md)

The Fellowship concluded with a discussion of the afterlife of digital content: how do web pages change over time? How can they be archived? How will the history of our present digital moment ultimately be recorded?

Laurie Allen, Assistant Director for Digital Scholarship at the libraries and one of the coordinators of the DS Fellows program, presented on her work with the Data Refuge project, which looks for ways to archive government-funded data sets that may be taken offline when administrations change. This sparked further conversation about the future of libraries and archives and the difficulty of archiving an internet that has become increasingly personalized to the individual user.

Following this session, Abigail Mcguckin reflected on her new understanding of the complexities of digital archiving and preservation:

"I've learned that the way we currently understand data is vastly different from the times of solely written texts. In this new age, preservation of current data and recontexualization/new analyses of old data using technology are novel ways to make sense of the world. This program taught me to really be conscious about what preservation [means], especially in light of the data refuge project." - Abby

# Fellows' reflections

"The DS Fellows program has allowed me to understand how much more technology can influence and assist in my research.  I do a lot of primary source resource,  so I thought tech was the antithesis to my  work, but that's not true. I think in terms of having a metacritical approach to data preservation is something I've also gained." - Amani

"The program has provided me with a useful sampling of many digital methods, some of which are directly applicable to work I'm doing in school and others that were added bonuses. I've gained a more well-rounded understanding of where digital tools meet academic methods, and my only complaint is that we only had time to do overviews of certain topics." - Nick

"The DS Fellows program gave me a wonderful perspective of how digital scholarship is steadily making its way into the academic scene of Penn and American education. It was also very useful to get a solid introduction to digital concepts and tools that will certainly show up once more in my future studies with Information Sciences." - Andres

# Looking forward

Three of the Fellows, Andres, Ying, and Maia, will be staying on for phase two of the DS Fellows program: a summer internship that gives students the opportunity to create ways of interpreting and representing Monument Lab data. Along with four new fellows, these students will develop visualzations and tools for use in Monument Lab 2017, which will bring a diverse group of 21 artists to create temporary monuments in Philadelphia, and continue to solicit speculative monument proposals from the public.
