#Project Work- Mapping Monuments and Philadelphia's collective memory

##Research
+ Locations for Monument Lab '17 will be announced on Thursday 2 February
+ In groups of two, pick a monument that already exists in that area and research

Examples
+ Type of monument (sculpture, statue etc.)
+ Topic of monument (social, religion, movement, gender)
+ History of location (what happened in that specific area-- any correlation to the monument itself?)
+ Cross-reference with any [Monument Lab](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/speculative-monuments-for-philadelphia), [historical preservation](http://www.preservationalliance.com/explore-philadelphia/), and [historical marker](http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/apps/historical-markers.html) data that we have to see the significance that other people attribute to the area

##Presentation
+ Present your findings to your peers, and brainstorm methods to represent this data on a map
  + How many maps?
  + How to interact with the map

##Mapping data
+ Use Mapbox to represent your data
+ Goal: have a prototype of a map by the end of the session
