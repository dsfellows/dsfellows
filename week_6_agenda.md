# Monument Lab proposal form
+ What is YOUR appropriate monument for the city of Philadelphia?

# Metadata: a brief introduction
+ Descriptive vs structural
+ Tension between detail/specificity and standardization
+ Control terms
+ Example: a [Franklin record](http://franklin.library.upenn.edu/record.html?id=FRANKLIN_50872&) for Johnson's dictionary

# Metadata for Monument Lab
+ Looking at our proposals and a few more: what kind of metadata can/should we record about these proposals?
+ What more interpretive categories might we want to add?
+ Take your proposal and one other and try recording metadata about them in this [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jF9mQ_3x6tBwN7NIXqiGCHloE9pND46-LntBAjA8m0I/edit?usp=sharing)
+ What problems come up? What categories are easier or more difficult to standardize?
  + Transcribing text, describing image?
  + Subject categorizations?
  + Benefits of standardizing location?
  + Medium?
  + Are you describing the proposal or the monument? (What metadata categories could we add that would refer to the proposed monument itself?)
+ Having done this, are there any categories you would add to the ML form?
+ How does this compare to the official ML data set?
