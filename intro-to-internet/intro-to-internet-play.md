## Scene One where Laurie gets a static page

**You:** Hey Browser. Show me this webpage. (http://www.upenndigitalscholarship.org/internet/learning.html)
**Browser:** - Hey Computer. Can I get on the internet? We gotta show Laurie this webpage.
**Computer:** Sure thing! We seem to be all hooked up to the internet, so I don't see a problem.

*[My agent begins her travels.]*

*[Goes to DNS office]*

**Agent:**  Hey Domain Name Service, Laurie's agent here. I’m looking for upenndigitalscholarship.org. Can you tell me where to go?
**DNS** - Ah. Ok. I see that the University of Pennsylvania Libraries has signed up for that domain name. They’ve got a server running on a computer over there in a server farm provided by Reclaim Hosting. They should be serving up that site at 128.39.28.2833
**Agent.** Got it. On my way!
*[travels to "cloud", which is one of many warehouses full of computers that store and serve the sites you visit. These warehouses full of computers are staffed and require massive electricity and temperature controls. The huge quantity of water required for cooling these warehouses has real environmental consequences. There is no cloud. There are wires and computers on earth.]*
**Agent:** Hellooo 128.39.28.2833. I heard you have a web server on this computer here. I'm going to go in and look for the files I'm searching for, cool?
**Server:** Yes. Welcome. What page would you like?
**Agent:** Well, I seem to be looking for a directory called "internet", ah. I see you've got that folder, I'll just take a look. I'm trying to find a file called "learning.html"?
**Server:** *[looking in folder]* Yep. Here's that file. 
*[Looks at it. ]*
It’s an html page -- great! Off you go!!
**Agent** – *[taking learning.html]* Come on, buddy! I’ll show you the way back to Laurie’s computer.
**Laurie’s computer -** You’re back! Thanks! Hey browser, here you go. This html page is coming through.
**Browser:** Got it. Wait! It says here that I need a couple of other files -- would you run and grab these css and javascript files for me
**Computer:** Yep. I’ll see what I can do. I’ll assume they’re on the computer I just came from, unless they say otherwise in the address. What's the address on those?

**Browser:** Ok. I need 2. This one says "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" In the folder you just came from, there should be a folder called "css." In there, it says I need a file called "main.css" Can you run and grab that?

**Agent:** No problem at all. 

*[begins trip over again - brings back css file]*

Here it is!

**Browser:** Great! In that mini-millisecond I started loading the page, but now I'll make it look nice. *[continues loading page]* Got it all! Thanks!!
**Internet:** Any time, friend!



## Scene Two, where Laurie gets a page made by a database

In this scene, everything is roughly the same, except Laurie runs into some errors along the way. Perhaps the DNS server can't find the page and issues domain will not resolve error (try going to http://www.laurieallen.asdfasdf/ on chrome)

And then you find the right host, but there's no such page in the directory (404 error (maybe a piece of paper given out by the server player if you ask for a page they don't have))



Then, you go to the directory, and go through the potential files (index.html, default.html).



Maybe another link takes you back to the site to get a page from a database. There the person playing the server has instructions inside the main folder instead of actual pages (or other folders). So, the instructions say to take the URL the person was looking for and go to that table in the database, copy the template from that table, and then go to other tables to fill out the data in the template with things like "header" "page content" "customized stuff" etc.
