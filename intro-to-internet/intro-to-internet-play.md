**You:** Hey Browser. Show me this webpage. (http://www.upenndigitalscholarship.org/internet/learning.html)
**Browser:** - Hey Computer. Can I get on the internet? We gotta show Laurie this webpage.
*[My agent begins her travels.]*
*[Goes to DNS office]*
**Computer:** Sure thing! We seem to be all hooked up to the internet, so I don't see a problem.
**Agent:**  Hey Domain Name Service, Laurie's agent here. I’m looking for upenndigitalscholarship.org. Can you tell me where to go?
**DNS** - Ah. Ok. I see that the University of Pennsylvania Libraries has signed up for that domain name. They’ve got a server running on a computer over there on the cloud owned by Reclaim Hosting. They should be serving up that site at 128.39.28.2833
**Agent.** Got it. On my way!
*[travels to cloud, (which is a warehouse full of computers on solid ground with electricity and temperature controls, etc)]*
**Agent:** Hellooo - I heard you have a web server on this computer here. Can I go in and look for the page I'm looking for?
**Server:** Yes. Welcome. What page would you like?
**Agent:** Well, I seem to be looking for a directory called "internet", ah. I see you've got that folder, I'll just take a look. I'm trying to find a file called "learning.html"?
**Server:** Yep. Here's that file. 
*[Looks at it. ]*
It’s an html page -- great! Off you go!!
**Agent** – *[taking learning.html]* Come on, buddy! I’ll show you the way back to Laurie’s computer.
**Laurie’s computer -** You’re back! Thanks! Hey browser, here you go. This html page is coming through.
**Browser:** Got it. Wait! It says here that I need a couple of other files -- would you run and grab these css and javascript files for me
**Computer:** Yep. I’ll see what I can do. ? I’ll assume they’re on the computer I just came from, unless they say otherwise in the address.
**Browser:** In the meantime, I’ll load what I can…[continues loading page] Got it all! Thanks!!
**Internet:** Any time, friend!
