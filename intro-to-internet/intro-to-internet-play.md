**You:** Hey Browser. Show me this webpage. (http://www.upenndigitalscholarship.org/internet/learning.html)
**Browser:** - Hey Computer. Can I get on the internet? We gotta show Laurie this webpage.
*[My agent begins her travels.]*
*[Goes to DNS office]*
**Computer:** Sure thing!
**Agent:**  Hey. I’m looking for upenndigitalscholarship.org
**DNS** - Ah. Ok. I see that the University of Pennsylvania Libraries has signed up for that domain name. They’ve got a server running on a computer over there on the cloud owned by Reclaim Hosting. They should be serving up that site at 128.39.28.2833
**Agent.** Got it. On my way!
*[travels to cloud, (which is a warehouse full of computers on solid ground with electricity and temperature controls, etc)]*
**Agent:** Hellooo - I heard you have a web server on this computer here. I’m looking for a page there.
**Server:** Yes. Welcome. What page would you like?
**Agent:** Well, as far as I can tell, it should be a file called learning.html in a directory (folder) called internet. Do you have that?
**Server:** Yes! One moment.
*[Looks at it. ]*
It’s an html page -- great! Off you go!!
**Agent** – *[taking learning.html]* Come on, buddy! I’ll show you the way back to Laurie’s computer.
**Laurie’s computer -** You’re back! Thanks! Hey browser, here you go. This html page is coming through.
**Browser:** Got it. Wait! It says here that I need a couple of other files -- would you run and grab these css and javascript files for me
**Computer:** Yep. I’ll see what I can do. ? I’ll assume they’re on the computer I just came from, unless they say otherwise in the address.
**Browser:** In the meantime, I’ll load what I can…[continues loading page] Got it all! Thanks!!
Internet: Any time, friend!
